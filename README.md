## Eco Food
In Eco Food, users enter their diet, and the app ranks the importance of various key nutrients and environmental concerns that stem from the food production process such as greenhouse gas emissions, water withdrawal, and land use. Based on these rankings, Eco Foods uses an algorithm to generate a weighted sustainability score for their diet, giving users insight on how they can improve. Eco Foods will suggest the best alternatives to improve sustainability in your diet while still taking your preferences into consideration.

## Inspiration
Inspired by highly interactive nutrition apps like MyFitnessPal, we wanted to give users a breakdown of their diet in terms of environmental sustainability. This breakdown focuses on United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals #12 and #13.

## How we built it
Utilizing Android Studio, we were able to efficiently create a frontend Android Application for our application. 

## Challenges we ran into
We found that communication was the primary inhibiting factor in our workflow. It was difficult to keep track of what everyone was currently working on, and led to some confusion in the process of developing our app. To resolve this, we set up clear tasks for each person and then individually reiterated what we would be working on to suggest there was no overlap.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Transforming, cleaning, and combing datasets into a more readable and accessible form for later use. Parsing the CSV files and effectively distributing the data into objects for later use in our backend to frontend data transformation pipeline.
Creating a clean user-friendly interface using an Android application.

## What's next for Eco Food
In the future, we would like add more foods to the existing dataset. Additionally, we would like to include suggestions specifically for diet restrictions such as Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten-Free, and Lactose-Free.
